First task for bitworks interview

algoritms made for example:

1. redis with atomic inc/dec/set functions
2. file locking on linux file system (flock)

some other posibilities:

1. atomic operation in apache shared memory like apc_inc/apc_dec
2. mutex with php with sem_acquire function
3. On POSIX systems rename provides for an atomic rename operation, so may be some way to use shell mv to store counter in file/folder name
